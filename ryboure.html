    <h2>Politics</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The Assembly</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The Assembly is a group of politicians, local leaders, guild representatives, religious leaders, and other figures of import. The goal of the assembly is to represent all the peoples of Ryboure, but it too is not untouched by corruption. </li>
			<li>It keeps The Regency in check.</li>
			<li>Representatives serve for life, or until their constituency is ruled to no longer have enough influence or stake for a representative, in which case their seat is removed, or their constituency sees fit to replace them</li>
			<li>Currently there are 380 members of the assembly, with plans to add more in 6 months. </li>
		  </ul>
		<li>The Regency</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The Reagency is headed by one member of the 5 original families.</li>
			<li>The families take turns for the 7 year regency and their centuries long alliances, deals, and subterfuge keep each other in check, and when that does not, The Assembly has the power to intervene.</li>
            <li>The families include:</li>	
			  <ul>
			    <li>Enbergleam</li>
				<li>Bronzefordge</li>
				<li>Ark'Thrun</li>
				<li>Flowvel</li>
				<li>Reyelli</li>
			  </ul>
	</ul>
		<li>Hands of the Regent</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The police/law enforcers of the reigon. They are followers of the Lawbearer, giving the Church a pseudo-direct control over law enforcement.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </ul>
	
	<h2>Religion</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Church of Erathis</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The predominant religious faction by far, the Church of Erathis is headed by members of the Reyelli family</li>
			<li>early 80% of people within the city subscribe to the ideals or institution of Erathis on various levels.</li>
			<li>They oversee all matters of law and civilization, which gives them a free reign to take a part in most all things happening in the city.</li>
		  </ul>
		<li>Lathander's Light Monestary</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>A small faction, with two branches in the band itself, Lathander’s Light maintains a devout, small, and somewhat understated following.</li>
			<li>Lathander’s Light focuses on preserving their traditions and teachings, and their one assembly member, Adrus Cinber, doesn’t make a habit of drawing the ire of other factions.</li>
		  </ul>
		<li>Changebringer's Following</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Representing those who wish to live freely, put their lives in the balance of chance, or who just believe in the luck brought by the Changebringer, many who follow Avandra live unpredictable lives.</li>
			<li>Does not have official representives in The Assembly or an official temple</li>
		  </ul>
		<li>Moridin's Health</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>With 6 temples around the city, Moridin’s following is heavily skewed towards artisans, crafters, and even some inventors. </li>
			<li>Brings 8 representitives to The Assembly with their political ties closely related to most guilds, only breaking from economic allegiance on matters of religious nature..</li>
		  </ul>
